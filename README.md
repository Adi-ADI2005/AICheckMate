# Image Processing Project

This project allows users to process an input image (`index.png`) and produces a resulting output image (`result.png`). The workflow is simple and user-friendly.

## Project Overview

- **Input:** `index.png` – the image provided by the user for processing.
- **Output:** `result.png` – the resulting image after processing.
- **Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or Python/Flask if backend processing), Bootstrap for styling.

## Features

- Easy image input via `index.png`.
- Displays the output image as `result.png`.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile screens.
- Loader animation for smooth user experience while processing.

## How to Use

1. Place your input image in the project folder and rename it to `index.png`.
2. Run the project:
   - If it's a web project, open `index.html` in a browser.
   - If it’s a backend project, run the server script (e.g., `python app.py`) and navigate to the provided URL.
3. Wait for the loader to complete (if implemented).
4. Check the output folder or page for `result.png`.
